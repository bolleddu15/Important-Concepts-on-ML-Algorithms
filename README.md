# Important-Concepts-on-ML-Algorithms
Yes,  ML Algo are little tricky easy to understand but hard to remember, So here are some few tricks that we can easily remember the concept behind the algorithm and use for problem solving. 


1. Linear Regression
Purpose: Predict continuous values.
Key Concept: Find the best-fit line by minimizing errors (least squares).
Used For: House prices, sales forecasting.

3. Logistic Regression
Purpose: Binary classification (0/1).
Key Concept: Sigmoid function to convert outputs into probabilities.
Used For: Spam detection, disease prediction.

5. Decision Trees
Purpose: Classification or regression.
Key Concept: Tree-like model based on feature splits.
Used For: Customer segmentation, risk analysis.
6. Random Forest
Purpose: Ensemble of decision trees to improve accuracy.
Key Concept: Multiple trees voting for better performance.
Used For: Credit scoring, recommendation systems.
7. Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Purpose: Classification tasks.
Key Concept: Find the best separating hyperplane.
Used For: Image recognition, text categorization.
8. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Purpose: Classification and regression.
Key Concept: Classify based on nearest data points.
Used For: Handwriting detection, recommendation engines.
9. Naive Bayes
Purpose: Classification using probabilities.
Key Concept: Assumes independence between features.
Used For: Sentiment analysis, medical diagnosis.
10. K-Means Clustering
Purpose: Group data into clusters.
Key Concept: Minimize distance between points and cluster centroids.
Used For: Market segmentation, image compression.
11. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
Purpose: Dimensionality reduction.
Key Concept: Find principal components that explain most variance.
Used For: Feature extraction, data visualization.
12. Neural Networks
Purpose: Complex tasks (classification, regression).
Key Concept: Layers of interconnected nodes (neurons).
Used For: Deep learning, AI applications.
13. Gradient Descent
Purpose: Optimization algorithm for training models.
Key Concept: Minimize cost function by adjusting weights.
Used For: Model training across ML algorithms.
